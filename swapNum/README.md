# Swap Numbers

This project is a simple C program that demonstrates two different methods to swap the values of two integers without using a temporary variable. It includes traditional addition/subtraction and bitwise XOR operations.

## Features

- Swap two numbers using addition and subtraction.
- Swap two numbers using bitwise XOR.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

### Usage

1. Compile the code using the following command:
    ```sh
    gcc -o swapNum swapNum.cpp
    ```
2. Run the executable:
    ```sh
    ./swapNum
    ```
