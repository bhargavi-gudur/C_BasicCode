# Array Example in C

## Overview
This project contains a simple C program that demonstrates the usage of arrays. The program includes a function to print the elements of an array along with their indices.

## Files
- `array.c`: This is the main C file containing the implementation of the array printing function.

# Array Example in C

## Concept
This project demonstrates the usage of arrays in C programming. Arrays are fundamental data structures that store elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. This example provides a basic understanding of array declaration, initialization, and iteration through its elements using a loop.

## Build
To build the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system. For instance, you can use `gcc`, which is widely available on various platforms.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `array.c` file.
4. Compile the program using the following command:
    ```sh
    gcc array.c -o array
    ```
5. Run the compiled executable:
    ```sh
    ./array
    ```

## Description
This project includes a simple C program that initializes an array of integers and prints each element along with its index. The primary focus is on understanding how arrays work and how to iterate through them using a loop. The example is straightforward and provides a clear illustration of array manipulation in C.
