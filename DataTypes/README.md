# Data Types Demonstration in C

## Overview

This project demonstrates the usage of various fundamental data types in the C programming language. The program prompts the user to input values for different data types and displays the values along with their sizes.

## File Description

- **datatypes.c**: The main source file that contains the implementation of the program.

## How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile** the program using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`):
   ```sh
   gcc datatypes.c -o datatypes
2. **Run the executable**

    ```sh
   ./datatypes
