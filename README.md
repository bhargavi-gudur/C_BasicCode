# C_BasicCode

 ** C_BasicCode ** – 
A repository dedicated to fundamental concepts and techniques in C programming. 
This repository is designed for beginners and intermediate learners who want to strengthen their foundation in C.

## Overview

This repository covers essential C programming concepts with practical examples. Each program is crafted to demonstrate basic yet important techniques in C, making it an ideal resource for learners aiming to develop a solid understanding of the language.

## Getting Started

If you’re new to C programming, this repository will guide you through the basics. Each program is structured with easy-to-follow code and comments, explaining each step for better understanding.

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of programming
- A C compiler (like GCC or Clang)

## Topics Covered

Some of the key topics covered include:

- ** Data Types and Variables**
- ** Operators and Expressions**
- ** Control Statements** (if,if-else, switch, loops)
- **Functions and Recursion**
- **Pointers and Memory Management**
- **Arrays, Strings, and Structures**
- ** File Handling **
- ** Error Handling **

## Installation

To run the code locally:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone
 https://github.com/yourusername/C_BasicCode.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory:

    ```bash
    cd C_BasicCode
    ```

3. Compile and run any program:

    ```bash
    gcc program_name.c -o program_name
    ./program_name

    ```

## Examples

Here are a few examples from the repository:

- **hello_world.c** -
 A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

- ** factorial.c ** - 
Calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.

- ** pointer_basics.c ** - 
Demonstrates pointer operations and memory management.

## Repository Structure

### 1. `Update README.md`

This folder tracks updates to the `README.md` files throughout the repository. It contains the latest changes and improvements.

### 2. `addition`

This folder contains a simple program to perform basic addition of numbers. It also includes pointer programs and `README.md` for more details.


### 3. `array`

The array printing function program. It includes examples of how to declare, initialize, and print arrays.

### 4. `ascii_basic_code`

This program displays the ASCII values of characters. It is a basic program to understand the relationship between characters and their integer values.

### 5. `enumerator`
Contains a program that demonstrates the use of enumerations and switch statements within a function.

### 6. `hello`

The `hello` folder contains the basic "Hello, World!" program. It is the starting point for learning any programming language.

### 7. `odd_even`

Programs to determine whether numbers are odd or even using call by reference.

### 8. `pointer`

Includes addition programs and pointer manipulation programs. Contains `README.md` for more context.

### 9. `pos_neg`

A program that uses enumeration and switch statements within a function to determine if a number is positive or negative.

### 10. `ptr_swap`
This program demonstrates how to use pointers to swap the values of two numbers.

### 11. `structure`

Programs that use structures to perform various tasks, like calculating the area of a circle.

### 12. `sumof_nums`

This folder contains a program that calculates the sum of numbers in an array, demonstrating basic array manipulation and summation.

### 13. `swapNum`

Programs to swap numbers. The file extension was changed from `.cpp` to `.c`.

### 14. `switch_case`

Programs using switch case to determine if a number is positive or negative.

### 15. `vowelorconstant`

Programs to check whether a character is a vowel or consonant.
